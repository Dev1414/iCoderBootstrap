        <p> Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight,<br>
            although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances,<br>
            such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).<br>
            Chickens<sup><a href="some_source.com">[1]</a></sup> may occasionally fly briefly to explore their
            surroundings,<br>
            but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.<br>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>"Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird. However, thanks to its
                usage
                on
                restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
                American
                English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or
                'domestic
                fowl'
            </p>

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>According to <b>Merriam-Webster</b>, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late
            18th cen tury as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock", and is widely
            used
            throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night</p>
